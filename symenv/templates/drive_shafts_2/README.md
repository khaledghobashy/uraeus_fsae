[^1]: The tool uses [euler-parameters](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Multibody_Mechanics/Euler_Parameters) -which is a 4D unit quaternion- to represents bodies orientation in space. This makes the generalized coordinates used to fully define a body in space to be **7,** instead of **6**, it also adds an algebraic equation to the constraints that ensures the unity/normalization of the body quaternion. This is an important remark as the calculations of the degrees-of-freedom depends on it.
